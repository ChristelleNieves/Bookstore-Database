# Bookstore-Database
A bookstore database created using MySQL.
Note: This was a project for my Theory and Structure of Databases class in which I created a fictional bookstore database.
The scripts were created with the purpose of gaining practice with concepts within MySQL including triggers, stored procedures, etc.
