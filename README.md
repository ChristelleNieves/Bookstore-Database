# Bookstore-Database
A bookstore database created using MySQL.
Note: This was a project for my Theory and Structure of Databases class in which I created a fictional bookstore database.
The scripts were created with the purpose of gaining practice with concepts within MySQL including creating tables, triggers, and stored procedures. All data inserted in this database is fictional including customer names, payment methods, etc.
